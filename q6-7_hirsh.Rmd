6. Which Brewery has the highest rated beers?
```{r}
#GET HIGHEST RATED BY BREWERY
highest_rated_by_brewery <- function(name) {
  return (beers %>% 
  group_by(Brewery) %>% 
  summarize(
   Rating = mean({{name}})
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Rating)) %>%
  slice(1:5))
}

#GET BAR GRAPH OF RANKING
bar_graph <- function(df, name) {
  return ({{df}} %>%
    mutate(Brewery = factor(Brewery, levels = unique(Brewery))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=Brewery, y=Rating, fill=Brewery)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(min({{df}}$Rating), max({{df}}$Rating))) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none") +
    labs(title = paste("Top 5 Highest Rated by Brewery:", name))
  )
}

#GET AND GRAPH ALL RANKINGS
overall <- highest_rated_by_brewery(review_overall)
aroma <- highest_rated_by_brewery(review_aroma)
appearance <- highest_rated_by_brewery(review_appearance)
palate <- highest_rated_by_brewery(review_palate)
taste <- highest_rated_by_brewery(review_taste)
bar_graph(overall, "Overall")
bar_graph(aroma, "Aroma")
bar_graph(appearance, "Appearance")
bar_graph(palate, "Palate")
bar_graph(taste, "Taste")

#CONCATENATE ALL RANKINGS
df_list <- list(overall, aroma, appearance, palate, taste)
df_concat <- Reduce(function(x, y) merge(x, y, all=TRUE), df_list) 
df_concat <- df_concat %>% 
  group_by(Brewery) %>%
  summarize(
    Count = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(Count)
df_concat %>% 
    mutate(Brewery = factor(Brewery, levels = unique(Brewery))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x=Brewery, y=Count, fill=Brewery)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity") +
    coord_flip() +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    labs(title = "Top 5 Ranking: Frequency by Brewery")

```



7. How does the IBU score affect the overall score?
```{r}
ggplot(beers, aes(x = Min.IBU, y = review_overall, color = factor(Min.IBU))) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = paste("IBU and Overall Review"))
```
